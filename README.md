Response to authors:

```
I was confused by the directions in the first example, for the word
"infinite" where a valid anagram has the word "I" in it. Later in that
section it says the word list should "ignore the single character
words."

I'm not thrilled with either of my solutions. For the first, I think
next time I'd like to investigate into alternative data structures
that might be more efficient (i.e., not have to use a power set of
select permutations). For the second, parts can be DRY'ed up,
simplified, and ... reading character-by-character probably can be
avoided as noted in the comments.
