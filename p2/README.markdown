Problem 2
---------

Summary:

Write a clone of the tail program available in unix/linux systems but
only support a very small subset of the flags/options/features it
supports. Pick and choose the complexity/scope based on the time you
have and the options you like to support. Support at least the basic
functionality you get with no options.
